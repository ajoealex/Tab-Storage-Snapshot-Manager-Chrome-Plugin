🚀 Easily capture and inject localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies of any tab with just one click!

This extension helps developers and testers capture browser tab state (local/session storage + cookies), review and restore them later.

### 🔧 Features:
- 📸 Capture tab's current localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies
- 🗂️ View saved sessions with URL, title, and timestamp
- ⏪ Inject saved storage and cookies back into any active tab
- 🧹 Remove individual or all saved sessions
- 🔐 All data stays local — nothing leaves your machine

### 🧪 Ideal For:
- QA engineers testing page flows and state restoration
- Developers debugging multi-tab web apps
- Working with authentication or session-heavy apps

### 🛠️ How to Use:
1. Click "Capture Current Session" on any page
2. View the captured entries in the popup
3. Click a session card to inject its data into the current tab

> 💡 Tip: Use it with incognito window (if enabled in extension settings) to simulate fresh user state.
